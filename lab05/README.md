# Lab05: Ensemble Models - Applied Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for Lab 5: Ensemble Models from the Applied Machine Learning course. The task involves training and evaluating different ensemble models, including Random Forest and AdaBoost, on a dataset (e.g., the Spirals dataset). The goal is to analyze the performance of these models and determine which one performs best for the given task.
